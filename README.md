Question
The reader-writer problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer 
science, where multiple process execution (or thread) competes for shared 
resources. The reader-writer problem has two types of threads: readers and 
writers. Readers only read the shared resource, while writers read and write to 
it. The problem is to ensure that no writer thread is allowed to enter the critical 
section while a reader thread is accessing the shared resource and vice versa. 
Additionally, multiple readers can read the shared resources, but only single 
writers can access shared resources simultaneously.
Answer
implementation of the starvation-free reader-writer problem. Using four 
variables, two integer types and two Boolean types.

Variable and their use in the program:
1. Readers: An integer variable initially set to 0 shows the number of 
readers in the critical section and ensures that writers wait when 
readers are in the critical section.
2. writing: A Boolean variable initially set to false shows that the writer 
accesses the critical section, and other readers and writers should wait 
for the critical section.
3. readersTurn: A Boolean variable initially set to false shows the readerâ€™s 
turn to read the critical section.
4. waitWriter: An integer variable initially set to 0 shows the waiting time 
for writers to access the critical section. When writers wait,then first 
waiting, writers access the critical section.


**How this solution solves starvation problems?**

We consider the scenario that when readers first go for critical, which first 
check writing || waitWriters && !reaadersTurn condition initially is the whole 
condition is false then go to for critical condition and read then when writers 
come and try to get the critical section it is checked readers>0 || writing
condition this is true then update waitWriters by adding one and wait for 
critical section. Another reader tries to access the critical section, which 
checks the writing || waitWriters && !readers turn condition, which is true, then 
wait for the critical section. Here first readers finish his work and come out 
from the critical section, which decreases readers by one, readerTurn to false,
and if readers==0,then calls informAll() function. In this case, if the second 
reader tries to access the critical section,then it is checked writing || 
waitWriters && !reaadersTurn condition, which is true due to waitWriters
variable then wait then writers go for a critical section then checked readers>0 
|| writing condition which is false then access the critical section. Writers are 
not in starvation. This is the way readers are also not in starvation conditions.
